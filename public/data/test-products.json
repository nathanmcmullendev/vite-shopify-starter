      "description": "Winslow Homer was known for his robust depictions of nature. In High Cliff, Coast of Maine, the ocean wages a mighty and relentless assault on a rocky cliff at Prout's Neck, one of the artist's favorite spots on the coast. Both the two small figures at the upper right and the tight composition heighten the viewer's sense of the powerful surf.",

      "description": "A Visit from the Old Mistress captures a tentative encounter in the postwar South. The freed slaves are no longer obliged to greet their former mistress with welcoming gestures, and one remains seated as she would not have been allowed to do before the war. Winslow Homer composed the work from sketches he had made while traveling through Virginia; it conveys a silent tension between two communities seeking to understand their future. The formal equivalence between the standing figures suggests the balance that the nation hoped to find in the difficult years of Reconstruction.Exhibition Label, Smithsonian American Art Museum, 2006",

      "description": "In 1868, Winslow Homer took up the subject of people who worked in textile mills. Mill operatives’ activities were organized by bells that rang throughout the day. Before mid-century, Americans viewed factories as places where respectable folk—mostly women—could earn a decent income and make a contribution to the nation’s industrial transformation. By the time Homer created his picture, native-born farmwives and their daughters had long been absent from the mills. Recent immigrants and the desperately poor replaced them at the looms, the only takers for work that offered the barest sustenance.",

In his mind, the American Revolution was like the biblical story of the Great Flood, sweeping away the despotism of the British Crown. In this painting the waters from that Flood subside, suggesting a peaceful future for the young republic. A lone skull resting against the rocks suggests that the world has been washed clean of human folly. At the center of the painting, bathed in light, a dove flies toward land as the ark floats on the calm waters, ready to usher in a new and more enlightened era in America.",

By the end of their journeys, the pilgrim of the cross discovers the bright light and angels of redemption, but the pilgrim of the world finds only a wasteland of emptiness and fear.
