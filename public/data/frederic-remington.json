At the time of his death the “industrious pamphleteer and popular speaker” was president of the New-York Historical Society and the New York Society Library. This animated portrait was commissioned posthumously by the lawyer’s son John. De Peyster’s clenched jaw and furrowed brow convey the determination and integrity noted in memorial tributes at the time of his death.",

He had read Darwin's books and Alexander von Humboldt's descriptions of Cotopaxi,\"the most dreadful volcano...its explosions most frequent and disastrous.\"The fabled Ecuadorian mountain provided both a poetic symbol of God's creation and an exciting window into the planet's natural history. Geology was a new science in the nineteenth century, and Church was among those who believed that volcanoes offered clues to the age and origins of the earth.On his first visit to Ecuador, the artist waited an entire day near the hacienda pictured here, hoping that the clouds would part to reveal the peak. American critics complained that Church's paintings of the volcano did not capture the soft atmospheric haze that they were used to seeing in landscapes. Those who had never traveled to the high country of the Andes did not understand that in the thin, clear air, Cotopaxi's icy flanks gleamed just as Church had painted them.Exhibition Label, Smithsonian American Art Museum, 2006",

The auroras above erupt in a cascade of eerie lights, while the dogsled implies the hope of rescue from this icy prison. Hayes and Frederic Church were friends, and upon Hayes's return from the Arctic in 1861, he gave Church his sketches as inspiration for this painting. When Hayes returned to New York, the country was in the thick of civil war and, in a rousing speech, he vowed that \"God willing, I trust yet to carry the flag of the great Republic, with not a single star erased from its glorious Union, to the extreme Northern limits of the earth.\"",

      "description": "Frederick Arthur Bridgman created this painting in 1869 while living at an artists’ colony in Pont-Aven, Brittany. He was still a student at the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris and this was the first year that he succeeded in exhibiting work at the prestigious Paris Salon. Many artists spent time at Pont-Aven during the nineteenth century, looking for a “primitive” experience that was very different from modern life in Paris. Bridgman and his fellow artists passed their days painting from models such as this young peasant girl. Bright light illuminates the girl’s cheek, nose, and dress, but the long lock of dark hair casts most of her face into shadow. She looks down, intent on winding the ribbon around her hair and apparently oblivious to the presence of the painter. Bridgman’s warm colors and sensitive brushstrokes capture the innocence of a girl not yet old enough to “put up” her hair as grown women would do.",

      "description": "William Morris Hunt turned his attention to landscape painting during the 1870s, and he traveled as far south as Florida, as far west as Mexico, and north to 'Niagara Falls' in search of great views. Many of his canvases from this time, such as this image of The Spouting Whale, are painted loosely, with broad brushstrokes and indistinct forms. The cloudy sky dominates the image, in which we can just make out a geyser of water from a whale below the surface. Although we cannot see the great creature, Hunt conveyed the whale's power in the dark shadows of the choppy water and the vivid contrasts in the sky. The image evokes a sense of foreboding, as if the whale might surge out of the water at any moment. The Spouting Whale conveys the drama of the seas at a time when many American painters, such as Frederic Edwin Church and Martin Johnson Heade, embarked on voyages to new frontiers.",

Evans, a wealthy dentist living in Paris, commissioned Cyrus Dallin to create a \"colossal\" statue of French general Marquis de Lafayette (1757-1834) on horseback. Evans was inspired by France's gift of Frederic Bartholdi's Statue of Liberty (a model of which is on display in the main galleries) and wanted to honor the French \"in gratitude for the services that Lafayette and his companions in arms rendered\" in the American Revolution. Lafayette was an aristocrat who shared the ideals of French liberal intellectuals of the time. At the age of nineteen, against the strict veto of King Louis XVI, Lafayette enlisted in Washington's Continental army as a volunteer. He proved himself worthy of command, and Washington soon promoted him to major general \"in consideration of his zeal, illustrious family and connexions.\" Lafayette later became a leader of the French Revolution and wrote his country's Declaration of Rights based on Thomas Jefferson's Declaration of Independence. Dallin wanted to portray the nobleman as a leader of his people, so he cast Lafayette on horseback, posed as if he were surveying his troops.",
