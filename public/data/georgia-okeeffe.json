Recent research suggests that this miniature is not of Bulloch, however, because it was painted several years after his death. It may show one of his sons, James, Archibald Stobo, or William, who were in their late teens and twenties at the time of the portrait.",

The Moravians were a communal society that began in the fifteenth century in Moravia and Bohemia, which today are parts of the Czech Republic. Many Moravians settled in Georgia, Pennsylvania, and North Carolina, seeking the religious freedom that led many people of various faiths to migrate to America.",

McKenney commissioned a well-known Washington portraitist, Charles Bird King, to paint the leaders of about twenty Native American tribes. This painting is a copy of King's portrait of Apauly-Tustennuggee, who was a member of the Creek delegation that challenged the validity of the Treaty of Indian Springs of 1825, which demanded the cession of all Creek lands in the state of Georgia in exchange for cash payments. McKenney described Apauly-Tustennuggee as \"a chief and a warrior . . . a firm, brave man–and of good sense.\" (James D. Horan, The McKenney-Hall Portrait Gallery of American Indians, 1972)",
