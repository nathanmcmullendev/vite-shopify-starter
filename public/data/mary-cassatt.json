      "description": "Mary Cassatt spent a few months in Spain in the early 1870s. She went first to Madrid, where she copied the paintings of the Spanish masters, then established a studio in Seville. She made a series of paintings of Spanish life that emphasized the beauty and dress of the local women. This piece was exhibited at the 1874 Paris Salon under the title Ida, where it attracted the attention of French impressionist Edgar Degas. On seeing the work of Cassatt for the first time, Degas commented, “C’est vrai. Voilá quelqu’un qui sent comme moi” (It is true. There is someone who feels as I do).",

      "description": "The engraving on the back of this miniature reads: “Lorenzo L. Crounse and Mary Livingston Colin December 27, 1859,” indicating that this miniature was created to commemorate either an engagement or wedding. In 1861, Mary was told that her husband’s leg was going to be amputated due to a wound he suffered in the Civil War. Knowing that her husband would not want his leg cut off, Mary rushed to the hospital to stop the doctors. Lorenzo’s injury made him unable to continue serving in the military, and spurred him to enter politics. A popular Republican, he was described as being “dignified, serious, but possessed an unruffled tranquility” (Washington County Historical Association). He served as a justice of the Nebraska Supreme Court, U.S. representative from Nebraska, the governor of Nebraska, and was a member of the Nebraska State Senate. Mary died in 1882, leaving Lorenzo a widower until his own passing in 1909. The frame that surrounds the portrait of Mary is made out of a watch and the family’s gold wedding rings.",

In a letter to his mother-in-law, Morgan praised his wife as “an excellent companion at all times . . . full of spirits.” In this portrait, Mary holds a mandolin, a fashionable instrument for aristocratic ladies. She wears a lavish pink satin gown with a sable collar and pearls that adorn her sleeves and hair. This outfit was not typical dress for colonial women, but was invented by the artist to conjure eighteenth-century European tastes for all things related to the “Orient.” (Reinhardt, “The Work of Fancy and Taste,” Dress, vol. 29, 2002) Benjamin West painted this portrait from a miniature of Mary that her husband brought with him during his visit to London in 1764.",

      "description": "This work portrays Abbott Thayer's children one year after their mother's hospitalization for \"melancholia,\" or severe depression. Kate Thayer became physically ill while hospitalized, and Thayer wrote to a friend that her physical deterioration would not be so horrible \"were her soul visible\" (Anderson, Abbott Handerson Thayer, 1982). Thayer captured the sadness and worry of this difficult period in Mary's heavy-lidded, watery eyes and in Gerald’s searching expression. They look like a modern-day Madonna and Child. Their mother would live for two more years, but in this portrait it is as if Mary has already taken on her mother's role in the family. After Kate died, Thayer clung to his children as an emotional anchor, and he often depicted them as sacred figures.",

      "description": "It is not always possible to identify the sitter in a miniature portrait, and research is still being done on some of the works in the Museum’s collection. Miniatures became popular in England during the early 1700s, commissioned by wealthy families on the occasions of births, engagements, weddings, and bereavements. These paintings, elaborately set into lockets or brooches, provided the wearer with a sentimental connection to a loved one. The back of the miniature often revealed a lock of the sitter’s hair, symbolizing affection, commitment, or loss. The daguerreotype, invented in 1839, provided a cheaper, faster alternative, and portrait miniatures grew less popular. At the turn of the twentieth century, with the establishment of the American Society of Miniature Painters, miniatures enjoyed a brief revival.",
